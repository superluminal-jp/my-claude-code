# Output Standards

**Purpose**: International best practices and McKinsey-style standards for professional document creation.

**Governing Methodology**: McKinsey structured communication — Pyramid Principle, MECE, SCQA — applied invisibly. Framework names never appear in delivered output; only their rigor appears.

---

## 1. Logical Structure Frameworks

### 1.1 Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto, 1985)

Present top-down: conclusion first, then supporting arguments, then evidence. Analyze bottom-up, but always deliver top-down. Three rules govern all groupings:

1. Ideas at any level summarize the ideas grouped below them.
2. Ideas within a grouping are logically the same kind.
3. Ideas within a grouping follow a logical order.

Apply the **Governing Thought** principle: every document has one central idea at the apex. All supporting points serve that single governing thought.

### 1.2 MECE — Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (Minto, 1960s)

All categorizations satisfy two conditions: no overlap between categories (mutually exclusive) and complete coverage of the topic (collectively exhaustive). If analyzing profitability, separate revenue factors from cost factors cleanly. If segmenting markets, ensure each customer falls into exactly one category while all potential customers are covered.

### 1.3 SCQA — Situation, Complication, Question, Answer (Minto, 1985)

Frame introductions and problem statements using four elements:

- **Situation**: Agreed-upon facts establishing context (20–30 words)
- **Complication**: What changed and why it matters (20–30 words)
- **Question**: The specific problem to solve (up to 15 words)
- **Answer**: The recommendation with rationale (30–50 words)

### 1.4 BLUF — Bottom Line Up Front (U.S. Military, 1980s)

Begin every communication with the key conclusion or recommendation. Supporting detail follows. Decision-makers grasp the essential point without reading further.

### 1.5 Inverted Pyramid (Journalism, 19th century; Economist Style Guide, 2020)

Most important information first ("the lead" covering the Five Ws), subsequent paragraphs in decreasing order of importance. Readers can stop at any point and still retain the essential message.

### 1.6 Hypothesis-Driven Structure (McKinsey, 1980s)

Organize around hypotheses to test, not data to present. Form a hypothesis, identify conditions that must be true, gather evidence to prove or disprove each condition, and structure the document around the results. Apply the **80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle, Vilfredo Pareto, 1896)** — prioritize the 20% of analysis that yields 80% of insight.

### 1.7 Issue Tree / Logic Tree (McKinsey, 1980s)

Decompose complex problems hierarchically. Diagnostic trees break down "why" questions; solution trees break down "how" questions. Every branch follows MECE. Progress left-to-right from broad question to specific, answerable elements.

---

## 2. Reasoning Methods

### 2.1 Deductive Reasoning (Top-Down)

Apply general principle to specific case to reach a certain conclusion. Structure: major premise → minor premise → conclusion (syllogism). Use when established rules apply to the situation.

### 2.2 Inductive Reasoning (Bottom-Up)

Observe specific data points, identify patterns, form general conclusions. Use when building arguments from evidence without pre-existing rules.

### 2.3 Abductive Reasoning (Inference to Best Explanation; C.S. Peirce, late 19th century)

From incomplete data, infer the most plausible explanation. Use when certainty is unavailable. Frame conclusions as "most likely" with stated confidence levels.

---

## 3. "So What?" Test (Minto, 1985)

Every finding, assertion, and data point must survive the "So What?" test. Information alone holds no value; insight drives decisions.

Transform data into insight:

- **Data only**: "50% of leads converted in Q4."
- **Insight**: "Lead conversion dropped from 65% to 50% in Q4, indicating we lose qualified prospects late in the sales cycle — likely from extended decision timelines or competitive pricing pressure."

Anticipate the next question ("Why?" or "What should we do?") and answer it before the reader asks.

---

## 4. Language Standards

### 4.1 Plain Language Act of 2010 (U.S. Federal)

Use common words. Short sentences (15–20 words average). One idea per paragraph (3–5 sentences). Avoid jargon unless precision requires it, and define it on first use.

### 4.2 ISO 24495-1:2023 (Plain Language — Governing Principles)

Four pillars: **Relevance** (content matches reader needs), **Findability** (information is easy to locate), **Understanding** (language is accessible), **Usability** (reader can act on the content).

### 4.3 Elements of Style (Strunk & White, 4th Ed., 1999)

Core rules: "Vigorous writing is concise" — no unnecessary words, no unnecessary sentences. Use parallel construction for coordinate ideas. Prefer active voice. Place yourself in the background.

### 4.4 Chicago Manual of Style (17th Ed., 2017)

Consistent citation and formatting: headline-style capitalization for titles, footnotes or endnotes with full bibliographic detail, bibliography alphabetical by surname with hanging indents.

### 4.5 APA 7th Edition (2020)

Academic and technical formatting: 1" margins, double-spacing, consistent font (Calibri 11pt, Times New Roman 12pt), five heading levels, running head with page numbers.

### 4.6 Active and Direct Voice

Write "We recommend entering the market" not "Market entry is recommended." Use present tense for current state. Keep sentences under 20 words when possible. Specify: "processes up to 1,000 items" not "handles many items."

---

## 5. Readability Measurement

### 5.1 Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (Flesch & Kincaid, 1975)

Formula: Grade = 0.39 × (words/sentences) + 11.8 × (syllables/words) − 15.59. Target grade 8–9 for general business audience. Grade 6–8 for government or public documents.

### 5.2 Gunning Fog Index (Robert Gunning, 1952)

Formula: 0.4 × [(words/sentences) + 100 × (complex words/words)]. Target Fog Index below 12 for wide audience, below 8 for near-universal comprehension. Complex words = 3+ syllables excluding proper nouns, common suffixes, and familiar compound words.

---

## 6. Evidence and Citations

### 6.1 Source Hierarchy

Primary sources first (original data, experiments, official records), then peer-reviewed literature, then authoritative secondary sources. Distinguish fact from interpretation (COPE Guidelines, Committee on Publication Ethics, 1997).

### 6.2 Citation Standards

- **Academic/technical**: APA 7th Edition
- **Engineering/computing**: IEEE
- **Business/humanities**: Chicago Manual of Style 17th Ed.
- **International bibliographic references**: ISO 690:2021

### 6.3 Project Documentation

Follow ISO 21500:2021 for project documentation structure: scope, schedule, resources, costs, quality, risk management. Assign roles and responsibilities. Maintain traceability.

---

## 7. Visualization Standards

### 7.1 Tufte's Principles (Edward Tufte, "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information", 1983)

- **Data-Ink Ratio**: Maximize the proportion of graphic ink devoted to data. Target ratio ≥ 0.95. Erase non-data ink; erase redundant data-ink.
- **Chartjunk**: Eliminate non-data elements — heavy grid lines, ornamental fonts, unnecessary backgrounds, decorative imagery, 3D effects.
- **Lie Factor**: Size of effect in graphic ÷ size of effect in data. Must be 0.95–1.05 for honest representation.
- **Small Multiples**: Display multiple small identical charts with same scale to enable cross-category comparison.

### 7.2 Zelazny's Chart Selection (Gene Zelazny, "Say It with Charts", 1985)

Select chart type by message comparison:

| Comparison Type | Chart Form |
|-----------------|------------|
| Component (parts of whole) | Pie, stacked bar |
| Item (ranking/contrast) | Horizontal bar, ordered by size |
| Time series (change over time) | Column (discrete), line (continuous) |
| Frequency distribution | Histogram |
| Correlation | Scatter, bubble |

### 7.3 Cleveland-McGill Perceptual Hierarchy (Cleveland & McGill, 1984)

Accuracy ranking for visual encoding (most to least accurate):

1. Position along a common scale
2. Positions along nonaligned scales
3. Length, direction, angle
4. Area
5. Volume, curvature
6. Shading, color saturation

Prefer position-based encodings (bar charts, dot plots) over area-based (pie charts, bubble charts).

### 7.4 Few's Principles (Stephen Few, "Show Me the Numbers", 2004)

Tables for individual value lookup. Graphs for revealing patterns. White backgrounds optimal. Subdued grid lines. Apply Gestalt principles for visual grouping.

### 7.5 Gestalt Principles (Wertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, 1920s)

- **Proximity**: Elements close together appear related.
- **Similarity**: Similar elements (shape, color, size) appear grouped.
- **Closure**: Brain completes incomplete shapes.
- **Continuity**: Eye follows paths, lines, and curves naturally.

### 7.6 Required Visual Elements

Every chart and graph must include: descriptive title (action title preferred), axis labels with units (SI), data source citation, and legend or direct data labels. Captions mandatory (ISO 690).

---

## 8. Document Structure

### 8.1 Executive Summary

Structure: SCQA opening → 3–4 key findings (MECE) → critical implications → recommended actions. A busy executive grasps the core message in 3 minutes.

### 8.2 Body Sections

Organize into 3–4 MECE sections. Each section: conclusion first (section theme), then supporting evidence, then implications, then link to next section. Bold 2–3 critical figures per section.

### 8.3 Recommendations

Specify: what should be done, by whom, by when, with what expected outcomes, and required resources. Use active, specific language: "Launch pilot in Jakarta by Q3 with $2.5M investment" not "Consider expansion."

### 8.4 Action Titles (McKinsey/Consulting Standard, 1990s)

Titles state conclusions, not topics. Complete sentences of approximately 15 words with specific data. Maximum 2 lines. Example: "Q3 revenue surpassed targets by 12% driven by new product launches" not "Q3 Results."

### 8.5 Assertion-Evidence Structure (Michael Alley, 1990s–2000s)

Each slide or section: one assertion headline + visual evidence supporting it. Minimize bullet lists. Research shows superior audience comprehension and recall versus traditional formats.

---

## 9. Quality Assurance

### 9.1 Three-Stage Editing Process

1. **Revision**: Content accuracy, structure, logical flow, completeness. Does each section contribute to the governing thought?
2. **Editing**: Language refinement, sentence structure, word choice, consistency, readability. Eliminate redundancy.
3. **Proofreading**: Typographical, spelling, punctuation, and formatting errors. Final polish.

Execute in strict order. No point editing sentences that may be deleted during revision.

### 9.2 Content Quality Checks

- Does the document start with the conclusion? (Pyramid Principle)
- Are arguments organized without overlap and covering all cases? (MECE)
- Does each section prove one clear argument? (Single Message Discipline)
- Does every data point pass the "So What?" test?
- Are all figures specific, sourced, and in SI units?
- Are recommendations actionable with owner, timeline, and expected outcome?
- Can the core message be understood in 3 minutes? (60-Second Rule per section)

### 9.3 Readability Verification

Target Flesch-Kincaid grade 8–9 or Gunning Fog below 12. Sentences under 20 words average. No paragraph longer than 5 sentences.

### 9.4 Output Language Check

Delivered documents must never contain consulting jargon: "Pyramid Principle," "MECE," "SCQA," "So What?," "hypothesis-driven," or framework names. Use natural business language. The audience sees polished professional insight, not analytical scaffolding.

---

## 10. Audience Adaptation

### Highly Receptive Audiences

Lead with recommendations immediately. Minimal contextual setup. Focus on new insights and specific actions.

### Skeptical Audiences

Build extensive proof before stating conclusions. Address potential objections. Cite more sources. Show analytical rigor.

### Technical Audiences

Include detailed methodology. Show calculations. Use domain-specific citation style (IEEE for engineering, APA for behavioral science).

### Executives with Deep Domain Knowledge

Reduce contextual setup. Focus on what changed since last update and specific recommended actions. Respect their time.

Never compromise on logical structure, MECE discipline, or clarity regardless of audience.
