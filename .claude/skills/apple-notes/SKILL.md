name: apple-notes
description: Read and write Apple Notes from macOS through the bundled osascript (JXA) scripts — list a folder as JSON, fetch or resolve one note by id, create a note, and append to an existing one. Use when a request needs content out of Notes.app, when prose has to be recorded there (a goal, a decision, a retrospective, a log entry), or when a note must be linked to a reminder.
when_to_use: Any request touching Apple Notes or Notes.app on macOS — "what does my Sprint Goal note say", "write this up in Notes", "append today's decision", "find the retro note". Also load it before writing any AppleScript or JXA against Notes, so the HTML body model and the macOS-only constraint are known first.

# Apple Notes

Operate Notes.app from the command line through the scripts in this skill.

Run scripts by their absolute path so they work whether this skill is installed
at project or user scope:

```bash
osascript -l JavaScript "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/list_notes.js" "Scrum"
```

## Two constraints to state up front

**Notes has no framework.** There is no EventKit equivalent, no Contacts-style
API. Apple Events — AppleScript, or JXA on the same dictionary — is the only
supported programmatic route. Everything else (Shortcuts, Automator) is built on
top of it or is a GUI path.

**It is macOS-only.** There is no iOS route to write a note programmatically.
If a workflow needs to run from iPhone, the note side of it cannot; say so
rather than designing around a path that does not exist. Shortcuts is the only
realistic iPhone input path, and it is a human tapping a button, not automation.

## Before the first call

Two separate permissions, failing differently.

1. **Automation (TCC).** The first `osascript` call raises a dialog asking the
   terminal app to control Notes. Approve it, or pre-grant it at
   *System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation → (terminal app) →
   Notes*. Errors `-1743`, `-10004`, and `-10827` mean this was denied.
2. **Claude Code permission.** The `Bash(osascript …)` call itself prompts.
   Nothing here is pre-approved on purpose — these scripts change the user's
   own notes.

Neither can be granted non-interactively. On a headless run, say so rather than
retrying.

## The property surface

`id`, `name`, `body`, `creation date`, `modification date`, `container`
(and `folder`: `name`, `id`, `container`).

`id` is the stable handle — formatted `x-coredata://<store>/ICNote/p<N>`. Treat
it as opaque.

**`body` is HTML, not text.** Everything follows from that:

- Bodies are omitted from list output unless asked for (`--with-body`). A folder
  of retrospectives fetched in one call is a wall of markup nobody reads.
- `--plaintext` strips the markup for reading. Never round-trip that back into
  a body — it is lossy by construction.
- Text written into a note is escaped and wrapped in one `<div>` per line. A
  bare newline is whitespace in HTML and would collapse paragraphs into a
  run-on line.
- Notes derives the displayed title from the **first line of the body**, not
  from `name`. `write_note.js` sets both.

There is no query language. Filtering a folder means fetching it and filtering
in the caller — fine for a working folder, slow across a large account. Prefer
a dedicated folder to a search over everything.

## Scripts

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/list_notes.js` | A folder (or one id, or `--folders`) as JSON |
| `scripts/write_note.js` | Create a note, or append to one by id |

```bash
S="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts"

# Read
osascript -l JavaScript "$S/list_notes.js" --folders
osascript -l JavaScript "$S/list_notes.js" "Scrum"
osascript -l JavaScript "$S/list_notes.js" --id "<id>" --plaintext

# Create -- first line becomes the title
osascript -l JavaScript "$S/write_note.js" --folder "Scrum" \
  --title "Sprint 7 Goal" --text "Cut checkout drop-off on mobile."

# Append
echo "Retro action: shrink the WIP limit to 2" \
  | osascript -l JavaScript "$S/write_note.js" --id "<id>" --append-stdin
```

`write_note.js` cannot delete and cannot replace a whole body — only append.
Both are structural, not advisory. A note is prose the user wrote; a bad
overwrite loses it with no undo outside Notes.app. If a user asks for a
rewrite or a deletion, tell them where to click rather than working around it.

## Linking to a reminder

Notes' own "Add Link" feature is documented for Safari, Books, and Podcasts —
Reminders appears nowhere in it, and there is no Shortcuts action that returns
a shareable link or external identifier for a note. Undocumented schemes
(`applenotes:note/<UUID>`, `x-apple-reminderkit://`) exist but are unowned and
break without notice.

So links are stored as ids and resolved by script. Paste the marker into the
note's body:

```
[[reminder:x-apple-reminder://UUID]]
```

An inline marker rather than a fenced block, because a note body is HTML the
user edits by hand and a block would not survive. The reminder side is the
mirror image — a `note:` key inside the `--- scrum ---` block, defined in the
`apple-reminders` skill. Each skill states its own side so either one works
alone when it is the only one loaded.

Resolving either direction is an `--id` lookup. The trade-off is deliberate: no
one-tap native link, in exchange for a link built only on object ids, the most
basic and most stable thing both apps expose. Ids can go stale — verify a link
resolves before presenting it as live.

## Reporting back

Return the answer, not the transcript. A folder's worth of HTML bodies is not a
result; the two lines the caller asked about are. When a script fails, give the
error and which of the two permissions above is the likely cause.
